<img src="logo.png" class="center" width="310" height="205">

This is a web application developed by Super Simple Software to allow the management 
of calendar shifts for a particular company/enterprise. We expect it to display a 
calendar with workers assigned shifts, information about that employee and much more. 

The solution will be presented to our Software Engineering class and given a grade on 
functionality, creativity and usability. 

## User Stories - Functions 

- [ ] User can view calendar from a manager || employee view
- [ ] Employee can set their availability to avoid being scheduled then
- [x] Implement the Big-Calendar to have different calendar views
- [ ] User is allowed to login-logout to the application 
**Other functions as the project progresses**

-Update npm `npm install -g npm@latest`
-First use the command `npm run build` at least once 
-Proceed by running `npm start`

We decided to use Github's board implementation to keep track of the work
we are going to be completing throughout this project. This will help us work 
more efficiently, prevent overstepping and stay organized.
